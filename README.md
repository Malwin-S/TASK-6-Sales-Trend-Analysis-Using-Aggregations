# TASK-6-Sales-Trend-Analysis-Using-Aggregations

## Task Description

This task involves analyzing sales trends using SQL aggregations. The objective was to analyze monthly revenue and order volume.

## Data Description

The dataset used is "sales-data-sample". It contains sales transaction data. The relevant columns for this analysis are:

*'OrderDate': The date of the order.
*'Quantity': The quantity of items sold.
*'Discount': The discount applied to the order.

**Note** The dataset does not contain a column for 'UnitPrice' or total sales amount. Therefore, a direct analysis of monthly revenue wos not possible. Instead, the analysis focuses on total quantity sold and average discount as indicators of sales trends.
